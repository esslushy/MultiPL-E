Use the two given lists to build the algebric expression and return the evaluation of this expression.\n\nThe basic algebra operations:\nAddition ( + ) \nSubtraction ( - ) \nMultiplication ( * ) \nFloor division ( // ) \nExponentiation ( ** ) \n\nExample\noperator['+', '*', '-']\narray = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n=> result = 9\n\nNote:\nThe length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.\nOperand is a list of of non-negative integers.\nOperator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.\n\nHints:\nUse a for loop to iterate through the operator list.\nUse a for loop to iterate through the operand list.\nUse a for loop to iterate through the operator list to build the expression.\nUse a for loop to iterate through the operand list to build the expression.\nUse eval() to evaluate the expression.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    operator: List[str]\n    operand: List[int]\n    operator = arg1\n    operand = arg2\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand[0]\n    operator = operator[1:]\n    operand = operand[1:]\n    operator = operator[::-1]\n    operand = operand[::-1]\n    operator = operator[0]\n    operand = operand", "    \n    #
