If they have guessed correctly,\n// the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n// example:\n// compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n// compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\nlet compare (game: int list) (guess: int list): int list  = \n    let rec compare' (guess: int list) (score: int) = \n        match guess with\n        | [] -> score\n        | x::xs -> \n            if score = x then \n                score\n            else\n                compare' xs (score - x)\n    compare' game [] 0\nlet test() = \n  let candidate = compare\n  assert (candidate [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 1] [1; 2; 3; 4; 2; -2] = [0; 0; 0; 0; 3; 3])\n  assert (candidate [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0] [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0] = [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0])\n  assert (candidate [1; 2; 3] [-1; -2; -3] = [2; 4; 6])\n  assert (candidate [1; 2; 3; 5] [-1; 2; 3; 4] = [2; 0; 0; 1])\n  0\n\ntest()",
